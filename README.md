2. Use your HuggingfaceHub API key (from this [URL](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)) in the .env file
   ```
   HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token
   ```
   
3. Create a virtualenv and activate it
   ```
   conda create -n llama2chainlit python=3.9

   conda activate llama2chainlit
   ```

4. Run the following command in the terminal to install necessary python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the following command in your terminal to create the embeddings and store it locally:
